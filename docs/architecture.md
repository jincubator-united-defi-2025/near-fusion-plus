# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

NEAR Fusion+ implements a sophisticated DeFi protocol that combines limit order functionality with cross-chain atomic swaps. The architecture is designed for security, scalability, and interoperability.

## Core Components

### 1. Limit Order Protocol

The foundation of the trading system, providing:

- **Order Management**: Creation, validation, and execution of limit orders
- **Maker/Taker System**: Asymmetric roles for order creation and execution
- **Partial Fills**: Support for partial order execution
- **Invalidation Mechanisms**: Bit-based and remaining amount invalidation
- **Extension System**: Flexible order customization through extensions

### 2. Cross-Chain Swap System

Enables atomic swaps across different blockchains:

- **Escrow Factory**: Creates and manages escrow contracts
- **Source/Destination Escrows**: Separate contracts for each chain
- **Time-locked Operations**: Secure fund management with timelocks
- **Merkle Validation**: Efficient proof validation for complex scenarios

### 3. Escrow System

Multi-layered escrow management:

- **Base Escrow Factory**: Advanced factory with Merkle validation
- **Standard Escrow Factory**: Basic escrow creation
- **Source Escrow**: Manages funds on the source chain
- **Destination Escrow**: Manages funds on the destination chain

### 4. Fee Management

Flexible fee collection and distribution:

- **Fee Taker Contract**: Handles fee collection during order execution
- **Configurable Fees**: Dynamic fee structures
- **Token Support**: Native NEAR and fungible token fee collection

### 5. Merkle Storage Invalidator

Advanced validation system:

- **Proof Validation**: Merkle proof verification for complex orders
- **Storage Management**: Efficient storage of validation data
- **Multiple Fills**: Support for orders with multiple partial fills

## Data Flow

### Limit Order Execution

```
1. Maker creates order → Limit Order Protocol
2. Taker submits fill → Protocol validates order
3. Extension processing → Pre/post interaction hooks
4. Token transfers → Fee collection and settlement
5. Order state update → Invalidation or completion
```

### Cross-Chain Swap Flow

```
1. User initiates swap → Escrow Factory
2. Source escrow created → Funds locked on source chain
3. Destination escrow created → Funds locked on destination chain
4. Secret revealed → Atomic completion of swap
5. Time-locked rescue → Fallback mechanisms
```

## Security Model

### Multi-Layer Security

1. **Order Validation**: Comprehensive order structure validation
2. **Signature Verification**: Cryptographic signature validation
3. **Timelock Protection**: Time-based security mechanisms
4. **Access Control**: Role-based access control
5. **Reentrancy Protection**: Prevention of reentrancy attacks

### Escrow Security

- **Time-locked Operations**: All critical operations are time-locked
- **Access Token Validation**: Restricted access to sensitive functions
- **Secret-based Completion**: Atomic completion through secret revelation
- **Rescue Mechanisms**: Fallback for stuck funds

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies

- **NEAR Protocol**: Base blockchain infrastructure
- **Fungible Token Standard**: NEAR FT standard for token operations
- **Storage Standard**: NEAR storage standard for data persistence

### Internal Dependencies

- **Limit Order Protocol** ↔ **Escrow Factory**: Order execution triggers escrow creation
- **Escrow Factory** ↔ **Source/Destination Escrows**: Factory creates and manages escrows
- **Fee Taker** ↔ **Limit Order Protocol**: Fee collection during order execution
- **Merkle Storage Invalidator** ↔ **Base Escrow Factory**: Proof validation for complex orders

## Scalability Considerations

### Gas Optimization

- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized data structures for gas efficiency
- **Batch Operations**: Support for batch order operations
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand data loading patterns

### Performance Features

- **Merkle Proofs**: Efficient validation for large datasets
- **Partial Fills**: Optimized for high-frequency trading
- **Extension System**: Flexible order customization without storage overhead

## Upgradeability

### Contract Architecture

- **Immutable Core**: Core logic is immutable for security
- **Configurable Parameters**: Key parameters are configurable
- **Extension System**: New features through extensions
- **Factory Pattern**: Upgradeable through factory contracts

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics

- **Order Volume**: Total order volume processed
- **Success Rate**: Successful order execution rate
- **Gas Usage**: Average gas consumption per operation
- **Cross-Chain Activity**: Cross-chain swap statistics

### Event System

- **Order Events**: Order creation, execution, and cancellation
- **Swap Events**: Cross-chain swap initiation and completion
- **Fee Events**: Fee collection and distribution events
- **Error Events**: Error tracking and debugging

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Additional blockchain integrations
- **Advanced Order Types**: More sophisticated order types
- **Liquidity Aggregation**: Cross-chain liquidity aggregation
- **MEV Protection**: Miner extractable value protection mechanisms
